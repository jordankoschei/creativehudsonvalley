Creative Hudson Valley is an online publication featuring interviews with creative people of all stripes, living and working in the Hudson Valley.

It’s a love letter to the incredible dynamism of the Hudson Valley creative scene. We’ll celebrate artists and designers, filmmakers and musicians, chefs and brewers, entrepreneurs and community leaders. We’ll cover people doing the best work of their lives in Ulster, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and beyond. We’ll feature creatives at every level of recognition, from big names to local icons to the artisan next door.

Whether you’ve lived in the Hudson Valley for years or you’re a New Yorker who dabbles in weekends upstate, this publication is for you. Our region has long been sharing its bounty with the rest of the world, from its agrarian roots to our creative present.

I hope you enjoy reading and learning more about the interesting people doing interesting work in the Hudson Valley. I know I certainly do.
