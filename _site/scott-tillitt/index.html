<p>He’s also a founder of several other local organizations, including <a href="http://www.rethinklocal.org/">Re&gt;Think Local</a> and <a href="https://www.antidotecollective.org/">Antidote Collective</a>, “focused on making Beacon and the Hudson Valley a more vibrant, sustainable, locally-rooted and human-scale place to live and work.”</p>

<h2 id="hello-who-are-you-tell-us-about-yourself-what-are-you-passionate-about-what-do-you-enjoy-doing">Hello! Who are you? Tell us about yourself. What are you passionate about? What do you enjoy doing?</h2>

<p>Hi! I’m like you, really — but different. I moved to Beacon from Brooklyn in 2006 and very quickly fell in love with the place and the people, the mountains, the river, the creative energy — throughout the Hudson Valley, not just Beacon.</p>

<p>There are a couple quotes that inspire everything I do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing. —Arundhati Roy</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. —Mihaly Czikszentmihalyi, social psychologist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m passionate about helping to awaken a social and spiritual consciousness and transform failed systems; helping counter the material, disheartening and destructive messages too rampant in our culture; inspiring creativity for a more open, interesting and sustainable society; and especially igniting the mind, tickling the emotions, and stirring the soul.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-you-discover-the-hudson-valley">How did you discover the Hudson Valley?</h2>

<p>My then-girlfriend and I were living in Bushwick (Brooklyn), and she had had enough of the city. On a whim, she decided to move to Beacon and I followed along. I didn’t really know anything about it — this was 2006, when it was still relatively unknown — and I was reticent to leave.</p>

<h2 id="walk-us-through-a-typical-day">Walk us through a typical day.</h2>

<p>I work for myself, part of which includes running BEAHIVE, a coworking space that I founded on Main St. in Beacon in 2009. (I have other locations in the region.) So I spend most of my days in Beacon, floating between home and BEAHIVE and Main St. coffee shops and cafes.</p>

<p>I like to think of the entire city (yes, Beacon is technically a city) as one big <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheers">Cheers</a></em>, where everyone knows your name. It’s one of the things I really love about living here (and what can occasionally also be oppressive).</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption class="font-sans text-center">The outside of BEAHIVE, on Main Street in Beacon</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="where-are-your-favorite-places-to-spend-time-in-the-hudson-valley">Where are your favorite places to spend time in the Hudson Valley?</h2>

<p>Exploring all the cities, towns and villages, all of which have their own great character. Hiking various trails.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-have-a-go-to-coffee-or-beer-order-and-from-where">Do you have a go-to coffee or beer order, and from where?</h2>

<p>Cortado from <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/big-mouth-coffee-roasters-beacon-2">Big Mouth Coffee Roasters</a> or <a href="http://beaconpantry.com">Beacon Pantry</a> — and occasionally <a href="http://banksquarecoffeehouse.com">Bank Square Coffeehouse</a>, which has the best outdoor terrace in Beacon.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-you-do-your-best-creative-work">Where do you do your best creative work?</h2>

<p>See above about floating around various places (home, BEAHIVE, Main Street establishments). I have my hands in a number of things and wear a number of hats on my head and sometimes I just need to physically change my location as I change hats. I also get inspiration (which for me is actual creative work) by hiking outside and exploring the region.</p>

<p>One reason I was reticent about moving here from the city is because at the time the city was such an inspiring, energizing place for me. I soon realized after moving here that it’s also a stifling place (and has only become more so) and now I do my best creative work just being here.</p>

<h2 id="how-has-the-hudson-valley-influenced-or-impacted-your-creative-work">How has the Hudson Valley influenced or impacted your creative work?</h2>

<p>There’s space to breathe, not just physical space but energetic space, a different pace, a different way of life. It’s also simply smaller, easier to navigate, and relatively more inexpensive, all of which makes it easier to try new things and otherwise get involved.</p>

</figure>

<p>After moving here I was inspired to translate my professional background into a social enterprise (<a href="https://beahivebzzz.com">BEAHIVE</a>), a nonprofit (<a href="http://www.rethinklocal.org/">Re&gt;Think Local</a>), and various projects and community engagements focused on making Beacon and the Hudson Valley a more vibrant, sustainable, locally-rooted and human-scale place to live and work.</p>

<h2 id="whats-surprised-you-most-about-living-and-working-in-the-hudson-valley">What’s surprised you most about living and working in the Hudson Valley?</h2>

<p>I grew up in a small town in rural Missouri, and when I left the state after college, I lived in Chicago, Philadelphia, NYC, and briefly in Paris. Never did I think I would NOT live in a cosmopolitan city. In a way I’ve come full circle in the small community that is Beacon (though it’s obviously a far cry from rural Missouri). I’ve been here now for 13 years, longer than anywhere I’ve lived.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-part-of-any-local-groups-or-communities-youd-like-to-mention">Are you part of any local groups or communities you’d like to mention?</h2>

<p>For several years I was a board member of <a href="https://beaconarts.org">BeaconArts</a>, which for 13+ years has promoted Beacon’s cultural vibrancy. (I’m still a member.)</p>

<p>I was a fellow with <a href="https://goodworkinstitute.org">Good Work Institute</a>, which is doing, well, good work connecting and supporting people, projects, and organizations that are, well, doing good work in the region.</p>

<h2 id="anything-you-want-to-plug-or-promote">Anything you want to plug or promote?</h2>

<p>Stay tuned as BEAHIVE expands into other communities — I’m finalizing plans and agreements for Newburgh and Poughkeepsie and actively exploring others. And as we expand locations and members, we’ll also elevate our programming and impact.</p>
