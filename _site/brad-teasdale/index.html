<p>When I met designer Brad Teasdale at his studio in mid-September, I asked him why he calls his signature pieces ‚Äúmermaid benches.‚Äù</p>

<p>He replied: ‚ÄúHalf land, half water.‚Äù</p>

<p>His benches and tables are a fusion of driftwood and concrete, all sourced locally ‚Äî the wood comes from the Hudson, and the concrete is produced using Hudson Valley sand. The concrete, I should say, is unlike any concrete I‚Äôve seen or felt before ‚Äî rather than the coarse and gravelly material I‚Äôm accustomed to, it‚Äôs silky-smooth and completely uniform.</p>

</figure>

<p>I first became aware of Brad‚Äôs work from a piece in <a href="https://hvmag.com/home-real-estate/teasdale-design-studio/">Hudson Valley Magazine</a>. After corresponding via email, I drove down Route 9D from Beacon to Garrison to see his work in person and visit his studio, a workshop set back in the woods alongside his home and within earshot of a forest waterfall.</p>

<p>We walked behind the workshop to a porch covered with massive pieces of driftwood, slowly drying out for eventual use.</p>

<h2 id="local-wood-and-hudson-valley-terroir">Local Wood and Hudson Valley <em>Terroir</em></h2>

<p><strong>Brad:</strong> This wood is called black locust, and it‚Äôs incredible durable. Before concrete was used in building, black locust was prized for foundation posts and fenceposts because it doesn‚Äôt rot. I typically only work with locust, ash, or cedar.</p>

<p>Over the years I‚Äôve just been accumulating some awesome wood. This is all driftwood. I love working with driftwood. It‚Äôs all from the Hudson.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/brad-teasdale-3.jpg" alt="Brad Teasdale" class="w-full" />
  <figcaption class="font-sans text-center">Driftwood from an ash tree that grew around bricks from Denning Point, in Beacon.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>All these pieces are driftwood, so they don‚Äôt rot. It‚Äôs hard to tell how old some of these pieces are.</p>

<p><strong>Why don‚Äôt they rot?</strong></p>

<p>Most wood does rot, and then black locust and cedar‚Ä¶ if you think about Japanese hot tubs, for instance, they‚Äôre made out of cedar. In Japan they call it <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamaecyparis_obtusa">hinoki</a></em>, but it‚Äôs essentially cedar. I think it‚Äôs certain alkaloids that are in the woods, certain antibacterial alkaloids. I think that‚Äôs part of it.</p>

<p>This monster over here is black locust and weighs about 300 pounds.</p>

<p><strong>I‚Äôm impressed you were able to get this out of the water.</strong></p>

<p>This took a bunch of guys.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/brad-teasdale-4.jpg" alt="Brad Teasdale" class="w-full" />
  <figcaption class="font-sans text-center"></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Essentially, I let the wood season, and then I‚Äôll mill it down. The roots of the stump create half of the legs of a bench.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been working with concrete for about 20 years. When I was in my early 20s I worked with a stone mason, and we were doing construction-based work, so I‚Äôm using that construction science.</p>

<p>Each piece takes a long time to make. There‚Äôs the acquisition of the wood, the seasoning of the wood. And then, honestly, a lot of it takes place on its own.</p>

<figure>

<p>Concrete is kind of like baking. With any craft, the finer the materials, the finer your preparation process.</p>

<p>Some guys get this concrete that looks so smooth it almost looks synthetic, but I‚Äôm trying to make it look like stone a little bit. In my mix it‚Äôs just local sand and gravel ‚Äî you can kind of see the aggregate ‚Äî and cement.</p>

<p><strong>So you‚Äôre using almost entirely local materials, then.</strong></p>

<p>It‚Äôs all local. Hundred percent.</p>

<p>When we get into the idea of sustainability, part of it‚Äôs the ecological footprint of a piece, but I like to think of it also as the longevity of a piece.</p>

<p>These pieces aren‚Äôt going anywhere. And hopefully the design stays relevant ‚Äî that‚Äôs my goal, to make something that lasts, with a timeless aesthetic.</p>

</figure>

<p><strong>Something that I think a lot about is the idea of</strong> <strong>*terroir***</strong>; the essence of a place is imbued in stuff that‚Äôs made with those materials. Hearing that you‚Äôre making things with entirely local materials ‚Äî how do you find that the Hudson River, the Hudson Valley, plays out in your pieces?**</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a great question, and thanks for introducing the question like that, because as an artist and a maker of things, this series of work where I‚Äôm using the local wood is very refreshing for me as an artist, in the fact that it‚Äôs the materials, it‚Äôs the nature, it‚Äôs the lines of the materials, it‚Äôs the place itself that‚Äôs determining the direction of the piece.</p>

<p>So like with this piece of wood, for instance, this is a mere half of another bench that‚Äôs in a private residence up the hill. It‚Äôs not me coming along saying, ‚ÄúI need to make an angled bench.‚Äù I‚Äôm looking at the lines of the wood and saying, okay, this is the line that this piece of wood wants to make, so I‚Äôll do my best to finish that line.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/brad-teasdale-7.jpg" alt="Brad Teasdale" class="w-full" />
  <figcaption class="font-sans text-center"></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It‚Äôs a really beautiful process for me because I go out and find this wood, and the piece is already there ‚Äî the blueprint of the piece is already there. As I discover this Valley and this land more, looking for things, that‚Äôs where the inspiration is coming from. It‚Äôs really all from the place.</p>

<p><strong>You said it takes a whole crew of guys to get some of this wood out of the water. Do you identify the piece and then get the guys?</strong></p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll scout out the pieces, and it depends on where the wood is in the river. The Hudson‚Äôs very tidal, we get a three-to-four foot tide shift, so sometimes I‚Äôve got to get in there pretty quickly. If there‚Äôs a nice piece of wood I need to get it up out of the tide line and then come back to get it at our leisure.</p>

<h2 id="concrete-art">Concrete Art</h2>

<p><em>Brad and I walk upstairs to another section of his studio, where he keeps some art pieces he‚Äôs made.</em></p>

<p>I‚Äôm also an artist and, while I like to think of myself more as a furniture designer, I have more images and ideas and stories that I want to tell.</p>

  <figcaption class="font-sans text-center">A brontosaurus made of brass inlaid in concrete.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This piece is brass inlaid into concrete. I‚Äôve got some epic, megalithic stories I want to tell.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been doing this kind of artwork for about 20 years. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs heavily collected, but I‚Äôve sold pieces and people have them all over the country, as well as a couple of international pieces.</p>

<p><strong>How long have you been doing furniture?</strong></p>

<p>I‚Äôve gone through a few incarnations with my furniture. This series, using the raw wood and concrete, is about 5 or 6 years. But these other pieces are about 10 years old. I call that etched concrete ‚Äî it‚Äôs actually sandblasted.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption class="font-sans text-center">Detail of Brad‚Äôs etched concrete.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I‚Äôve always been making furniture too, but this new line has a life of its own and it seems to be ‚Äî and I hate to use such economic terms ‚Äî really keyed into where the market is right now.</p>

<p>Art is so specific, and the art world is so elusive. Getting into it is a lot about connections or luck, whereas design is based more on the quality of the craftsmanship. It‚Äôs a little more of an open market, at least to me. I‚Äôve had more access to the design market than the art market. And since these pieces are so much fun to make, I just go with it.</p>

<h2 id="the-philosophy-of-a-mermaid-bench">The Philosophy of a Mermaid Bench</h2>

<p><em>We start walking to the house, where Brad has several finished pieces situated. We pass a set of half-wood, half-concrete sculptures that he describes as ‚Äúmermaid totems.‚Äù</em></p>

<p><strong>Where does the name mermaid come from?</strong></p>

<p>There‚Äôs kind of a living quality. They‚Äôre half aquatic ‚Äî half of the land, half of the water.</p>

<p>Exactly. And that‚Äôs part of what I‚Äôm going for. I love juxtaposition. Even in my art, I try to juxtapose city and country, hard and soft, light and dark, rustic and modern. It creates a movement in the piece. With raw-edged wood in general, I find that a lot of people are working with raw unfinished wood now.</p>

<p>What I like to see is if it‚Äôs a really raw piece of wood, but then the carpenters‚Äô done some very fine joinery, some really precise butterfly joints somewhere. Something that actually elevates it.</p>

<p>This is the newest series I‚Äôm working on ‚Äî more planes of the wood. I‚Äôve got some coffee tables I‚Äôve made. I want to scale up to dining table size, given the right client. And I‚Äôve also got chairs based on a similar concept.</p>

<p><em>We look at one more bench.</em></p>

<p>There‚Äôs a little bit of a seam on this one. I could come back and plane it to get it perfectly smooth. That‚Äôs easy to do, but I‚Äôd kind of rather have them be two different things.</p>

<p><strong>It‚Äôs more honest, somehow.</strong></p>

<p>I find that when it‚Äôs a little too perfect, it starts to lose that <em>terroir</em>. It can start to look a little manufactured.</p>

<p><strong>Starts to look a little Pier 1 Imports.</strong></p>

<p>It does! And it‚Äôs funny, those guys are always one step behind. I used to do this glass inlaid in concrete. I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre necessarily copying what I‚Äôm doing, but some of us concrete guys were doing these thin finishes of concrete over wood frames, and a year or two later you‚Äôve got the box stores doing very similar things.</p>

<p>You can‚Äôt fake this. That‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî it just does take a lot of time. Even just finding driftwood that looks like this‚Ä¶ that takes time.</p>

<p><strong>I feel like there are so many people who are desperate to ‚Äúscale up‚Äù their operation, but something like this you can‚Äôt really scale because you can‚Äôt manufacture driftwood. It‚Äôs something that exists and you find it, and then you figure process around it. Your process is the same as the cement ‚Äî it fits around something that‚Äôs organic and already exists.</strong></p>

<p>That‚Äôs why, as a maker of things, it‚Äôs so refreshing for me: I don‚Äôt have to go out there like, ‚ÄúOh, this is what I‚Äôm going to make.‚Äù You find it and it‚Äôs there.</p>

<p>I could scale up in the fact that I could have more guys and we could bring in more wood. I could make two or three at a time. But I don‚Äôt think it could ever really be a mass market thing, just because it would be hard to get it down under 40 or 50 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Any frustrations living and working in the Hudson Valley?</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely. I think we‚Äôre still reliant on New York City. It seems like our towns ‚Äî Beacon, Garrison, Cold Spring ‚Äî there‚Äôs a lot of wonderful grassroots movement and growth happening, but I think if NYC wasn‚Äôt in the equation the market here would just vanish.</p>

<p>I think many other entrepreneurs in the area find it difficult to run a business here. The weekends, for instance, can be really busy for retail businesses, but the weeks are very slow. It‚Äôs tough to be in the economic sphere of Manhattan but without the sheer volume of people. Prices are practically as high here, but there‚Äôs just not the volume.</p>

<p>But that‚Äôs why we love it, too. That‚Äôs why we choose to live here. I‚Äôm not trying to make this place busier, but it‚Äôs a little frustrating to get something off the ground.</p>

<p>Maybe in a different place things can take off a little quicker.</p>

<p><strong>What is it that attracted you to the Hudson Valley?</strong></p>

<p>We‚Äôve been in Garrison about 15 years; we‚Äôve been in this home for about 8 years, we were at another property in Garrison before that.</p>

<p>I grew up in New Jersey, and then I worked in the City, but my dad‚Äôs family is from Poughkeepsie.</p>

<p>Partially because my dad‚Äôs from Poughkeepsie, and I grew up in north/central New Jersey. That family‚Äôs been there for four or five generations, so part of it‚Äôs just in me. I remember when my wife and I rediscovered it, it felt like coming home.</p>

<p>What was in my mind was, as a kid, driving down Route 9D. I remember these forested hills, I remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Rock_(Garrison,_New_York)">Osborne Castle</a> up there. It‚Äôs a special place. Traveled the whole world, and it‚Äôs unique to find this combination of natural beauty with culture and sophistication. I find it to be unique in the world.</p>
