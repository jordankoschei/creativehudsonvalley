<p>I am a person with a LOT of creative interests. I am a freelance illustrator who sings and writes musical comedy. It took me a while to find my way and narrow my focus because I love so many things.</p>

<p>Initially the dream was to move to New York City and audition for musicals because I loved to sing. I had a talent for drawing, but growing up I just didn’t take it very seriously. I went to college in Texas and got a BFA  Musical Theatre, then moved to New York. Not too long after I moved to New York, I realized musical theater wasn’t really the path I wanted. It had just been a part of my identity for so long that I couldn’t imagine not pursuing it. So now — obviously — I’m using my BFA Musical Theatre to be an illustrator. Life is funny.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I realized my real passion is storytelling, whether the medium is music or art. I realized the comedy songs I enjoyed writing so much were really just stories. The illustration is storytelling. It’s all connected.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-you-discover-the-hudson-valley">How did you discover the Hudson Valley?</h2>

<p>I was living in Harlem, and woke up one morning and thought, “I really need to be in nature.” I decided to go take a hike on Mt. Beacon. I didn’t realize how much I took nature for granted. I felt like I was in a Disney movie. There were animals everywhere — and they WEREN’T roaches, rats, or pigeons. Three months later I ended up impulsively renting a studio apartment in Beacon and loved it.</p>

<h2 id="walk-us-through-a-typical-day">Walk us through a typical day.</h2>

<p>No day or month is the same, but my days look like this right now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Wake up around 6:30ish (If I don’t hit the snooze 5 times). Myself or my fiancé <em>(“fiancé” is a new development. Still not used to it. We call each other “Beyoncé’s”. I’m sure we are the first ones to think of it.</em>) will make sure all the humans and pets in the house get fed, then my Beyoncé leaves the house and I go downstairs to my studio to work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I do illustrations, I take a break for 10 minutes every 2 hours so my eyes don’t shrivel up. I try not to check Facebook/social media at all during these breaks. Keyword is “try.” I saw a video of a guy jogging while his two macaw parrots were flying in front of him ON LEASHES. That derailed my focus for sure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I eat lunch and then go to the gym in the early afternoon. I notice I have a dip in mental energy in the afternoon and it’s better for me to do something that’s productive, but not creative.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I come home and take a shower, I let my pet bird (pineapple conure) Pebbles sit on the shower hose because he loves the water and sings his heart out. It’s adorable and definitely puts me in a great mood.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After that, I either run errands or do more work until later when my soon-to-be-step-daughter gets off the bus. I make her a snack while she tells me about school. She eventually runs off to play with any one of her 15,789 toys. She is absolutely delightful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will go downstairs and work until dinnertime. I eat, and do MORE work if I need to. If not, I try to interact with my Beyoncé.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m extremely grateful for my lifestyle and the people in my life.</p>

<p>Allagash from <a href="https://www.draughtindustries.com/">Draught Industries</a> in Beacon. Greg (the owner) makes fun of me because I always browse like I’m going to order something new, but I inevitably just circle back and get an Allagash.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-you-do-your-best-creative-work">Where do you do your best creative work?</h2>

<p>At home, alone with great music or a podcast. I have my little “L”-shaped workspace studio set up with everything I need. Sometimes I’ll be listening to a god-awful true crime podcast and doing adorable children’s illustrations at the same time, which cracks me up. I guess everyone needs variety in their life.</p>

<p>However, most of my ideas come outside of the studio. For me, there seems to be something about being in motion — driving in the car, running, etc. Something about motion gets my mind in a creative place. I guess I get my ideas outside of the house, then go be alone in my studio space to put them together.</p>

<h2 id="how-has-the-hudson-valley-influenced-or-impacted-your-creative-work">How has the Hudson Valley influenced or impacted your creative work?</h2>

<p>I noticed a pretty significant shift in my creativity when I moved from New York City to the Hudson Valley. When I started shifting away from my initial goal of pursuing musical theater and thought about what I really enjoy, it didn’t make sense for me to live there anymore. I was spending so much time making ends meet that I didn’t have the time or energy to be creative. I had to reassess what I wanted, and in order to do that I had to distinguish between two kinds of creative passions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The first kind is a talent for authentically and passionately interpreting someone else’s work.</strong> (ie, a singer in a musical didn’t write the songs, but she is responsible for  bringing the character to life in her unique way.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The second kind-the kind I realized I loved more, was making the actual work.</strong> I wanted to write the songs, or write the stories. I loved making things, and wasn’t necessarily attached to me being the person that ultimately performs or delivers the material.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Long story short, I had to course correct. I wanted to make the original work, and the idea of being in a quiet place with so much natural beauty really appealed to me. New York City is a very exciting place to be, but it’s oversaturated with artists. It is inspiring to walk around and soak up all the art and creativity that’s EVERYWHERE, but I also think those influences can drown out your own creative voice.</p>

<p>The city is where you live when you have a rock solid sense of who you are creatively — not to discover who you are and what you want to make. Just my opinion.</p>

<p>I know this is extremely obvious for most author illustrators, but join <a href="https://www.scbwi.org/">SCBWI</a> (the Society of Book Writers and Children’s Illustrators). I don’t know why I waited so long to join. I’ve only been a member for a short time and it’s been a fabulous resource for me, and the people are very friendly. I’m annoyed I didn’t get involved sooner.</p>

<h2 id="anything-you-want-to-plug-or-promote">Anything you want to plug or promote?</h2>

<p>Can I do two things?</p>

<p><a href="https://rickzshow.podbean.com/">The Rick Z Show podcast</a> — OK, so first of all the host, Rick, is hysterical. He talked to me about how women often think he is staring at them and being a creep, but he is legally blind. That is so funny to me I can hardly stand it. Anyway, it’s a great local music podcast about songwriters in the Hudson Valley. I recently <a href="https://rickzshow.podbean.com/e/julia-green/">recorded an episode</a> and played some of the new comedy material I wrote. Also, check out the episode with <a href="https://rickzshow.podbean.com/e/joey-eppard-part-1/">Joey Eppard</a> from the band <em>3</em>.</p>

<p>Another thing — I won’t elaborate on this, but if you want a really funny gag gift adult/children’s book, go to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Duck-Who-Lost-His/dp/1717814026">this link</a>!</p>
