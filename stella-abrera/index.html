<p>I met Stella at Kaatsbaan (pronounced <em>cahts-bahn</em>) one morning in late November to learn more about her work and to see the facility for myself.</p>

<p>Kaatsbaan is blessed by geography, occupying a 150-acre former horse farm just a stone‚Äôs throw from the Hudson River. It abuts downtown Tivoli, in northern Dutchess County, and was once the place where Eleanor Roosevelt rode her horses. The facility is spread across several buildings, from small studios to a 160-seat theater that matches the footprint of the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>

<p>Stella Abrera has been coming here for over 20 years, ever since she first joined American Ballet Theatre at the age of 17. Her career has spanned a diverse <a href="https://www.abt.org/people/stella-abrera/">repertoire</a> and countless accolades (the <em>New York Times</em> describes her as ‚Äúa luminous principal dancer‚Äù), including recent profiles in both the <em>Times</em> (‚Äú<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/arts/dance/stella-abrera-romeo-and-juliet-american-ballet-theater.html">The Poetic Justice of Stella Abrera‚Äôs Juliet</a>‚Äú) and the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> (‚Äú<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/30/magazine/dance-ballet-new-york.html">How to Be a Principal Dancer at 41</a>‚Äú).</p>

<p>This is her last season at ABT, and on January 1st, she‚Äôll assume the mantle of artistic director at Kaatsbaan, alongside executive director Sonja Kostich, herself a former ABT ballerina.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-your-role-as-artistic-director-entail">What will your role as artistic director entail?</h2>

<p>It will be mostly to program, to expand the programming, to help build the education department, to connect artists to this complex, to connect companies, private small companies, other dancers ‚Äî all different types of dance, not just ballet ‚Äî to come and create work here.</p>

<p>Basically just provide a cultural park for this area and give space and time to the major artists in New York City and around to really get some good work done. It can be so hard to find space ‚Äî there‚Äôs nothing like this in New York City.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre implementing master classes for local people. I just taught a master class on Saturday, had a nice turnout just from local people who want to see what the center is all about.</p>

<p>These first few months will be transitional months for me because I‚Äôm <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/arts/dance/stella-abrera-retiring-from-ABT.html">finishing my career</a> as a ballet dancer with ABT, so I‚Äôm still dancing full-time, but I‚Äôm laying down the groundwork so we can begin reaching out to different parts of the community within the area to get people here. I want field trips to happen. I want school kids to come here and observe rehearsals of these beautiful dance companies that are coming in from all over the place, and just expose them to what dance is. These will be the future dance lovers and art lovers, and it‚Äôs right here in their community.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-you-get-connected-with-kaatsbaan">How did you get connected with Kaatsbaan?</h2>

<p>My boss at American Ballet Theatre is one of the founders. I‚Äôve actually been coming here since I was a teenager. I joined ABT when I was 17, and I‚Äôve been visiting this place since then. I‚Äôve really grown to love this center.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sascha_Radetsky">husband</a> and I have a cabin across the river in Phoenicia, so we really got to know this area and fell in love with all the views around here.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-of-the-other-places-in-the-hudson-valley-youve-enjoyed-visiting">What are some of the other places in the Hudson Valley you‚Äôve enjoyed visiting?</h2>

<p>We really fell in love with the other side of the river, where we‚Äôve had our cabin for 15 years. We explore that area often. My husband and I like to hike, and my husband‚Äôs an avid fly fisherman. He says he‚Äôs terrible, but he‚Äôs obsessed with it. He‚Äôs also a <a href="https://www.abt.org/people/sascha-radetsky/">former dancer with ABT</a>.</p>

<p>Just exploring all of these areas near here, exploring different ways to go home over the river, hiking trails and waterfalls, those are all gorgeous.</p>

<h2 id="whats-surprised-you-about-being-a-creative-person-in-the-hudson-valley">What‚Äôs surprised you about being a creative person in the Hudson Valley?</h2>

<p>What‚Äôs surprised me is that there are so many creative people who come from different backgrounds, who have so many different stories, who all work in different mediums‚Ä¶</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a real welcoming feeling towards artists here, and art and culture, and it feels like a really wonderful thread embedded in the fabric of this place. I‚Äôm grateful for that. The fact that it‚Äôs so close to New York City helps to explain that. I just love how peaceful it is here, which is a nice contrast to living in New York City.</p>

<p>What you said is definitely something that we‚Äôd love to do ‚Äî to connect all the different types of artists and the huge network of artists that are in the area. It would definitely be great to get to know each other and to be friends and to partner.</p>

<p>Like I said, expanding the programming, bringing in dancers and choreographers who are up-and-coming, as well as established artists, to expose the Hudson Valley to all of that, and to expand our education, for sure.</p>

<h2 id="what-would-you-tell-someone-who-lives-in-the-hudson-valley-whos-considering-a-career-as-a-professional-dancer-is-that-something-you-can-do-from-a-home-base-in-the-hudson-valley">What would you tell someone who lives in the Hudson Valley who‚Äôs considering a career as a professional dancer. Is that something you can do from a home base in the Hudson Valley?</h2>

<p>I did it! I trained in my hometown school in LA, and I had the opportunity to audition for ABT through a summer intensive program, which is what we offer here. What‚Äôs cool is that, after 24 years at ABT, I have the eye and the knowledge to help train someone to do that, and to steer him or her in the right direction. New York City, the dance mecca of the country, is just two hours away. I could absolutely help someone who has that dream.</p>

<p>Of course, as we all know, a profession in the arts is going to be highly competitive, and a gamble. You dream big, and you work hard, and sometimes it still doesn‚Äôt happen. But I will always say that anyone who trains in dance learns so many incredible values that they can take anywhere ‚Äî the discipline, the perseverance, the hard work, the work ethic. All of those lessons that you learn as little kids in their pink tutus skipping around and following directions, all of that helps.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-the-future-for-kaatsbaan">What‚Äôs in the future for Kaatsbaan?</h2>

<p>We‚Äôre in stage two of Kaatsbaan‚Äôs five-year revitalization strategy. Stage one was to hire Sonja Kostich, who‚Äôs this amazing executive director, to reestablish Kaatsbaan‚Äôs place in the creative community and to spearhead its revitalization.</p>

<h2 id="would-you-say-kaatsbaan-was-under-the-radar-for-a-while">Would you say Kaatsbaan was under the radar for a while?</h2>

<p>It was. It was obviously doing good things because it‚Äôs still here, 30 years later, and it‚Äôs still pristine and all the dancers who comes here know what a special place it is. The founders put their feelers out, saying it was time to start searching for the new generation of leaders to help Kaatsbaan continue.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre hoping to make it flourish by reaching a broader network. That‚Äôs the idea.</p>

<h2 id="whats-coming-up-in-terms-of-programming">What‚Äôs coming up in terms of programming?</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs been very exciting to have <a href="http://www.ptamd.org/">Paul Taylor Dance Company</a> come and perform here. We‚Äôre excited to have <a href="https://markmorrisdancegroup.org/">Mark Morris Dance Group</a> come up here in May. And <a href="https://www.abt.org/training/dancer-training/abt-studio-company/">American Ballet Theatre Studio Company</a>, which my husband directs, will be performing here in April. <a href="https://www.unitedstatesartists.org/fellow/alejandro-cerrudo/">Alejandro Cerrudo</a>, an amazing contemporary choreographer who comes from a classical background, has a small company, and uses all the technical capabilities that the facility offers to create his work.</p>

<p>Another thing that you can do here at Kaatsbaan is rehearse with all these technical elements, which is really hard to come by, especially in New York City. Usually you create a piece of work in a studio with just the dancers and the work, and then you quickly go to the theater with a lighting designer who has these ideas, and you ‚Äî <em>bang</em> ‚Äî smash it all together in like 24 hours, and you hope that it‚Äôs what the choreographer wants.</p>

<p>But here, you can spend three weeks in a residency trying out different ideas with lights, the fog machine, with all these cool technical elements, and have the space and the luxury of no stress to do that.</p>

<p>All summer we have a nine-week summer ballet intensive program which I‚Äôm directing. Teachers from great companies, all different types of dance, will be here for each of three 3-week sessions. For each session we‚Äôll have about 50 students.</p>

<p>Right after that, I have a program called Pro Studio, and it‚Äôs a coaching and teaching initiative for young professional dancers. That‚Äôs also really exciting.</p>
