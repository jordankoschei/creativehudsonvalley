## Hello! Who are you? Tell us about yourself. What are you passionate about? What do you enjoy doing?

Hi! My name is NeeNee Rushie. I front [The Big Takeover](https://www.bigtakeoverband.com/). The Big Takeover has been creating reggae-like, soul-type music for the past 12 years. We have released four full length albums, and will soon release a fifth. We have toured nationally and have been recognized as the Hudson Valley’s Best Band in 2018.

I am very passionate about the project overall — from writing, to recording, to touring, and everything in between. My favorite part is performing live. I love the feeling I get when I am allowed to channel all my passion into a microphone and hear and feel the passion of my bandmates.

## How did you discover the Hudson Valley?

I went to college in New Paltz. I discovered New Paltz by chance, really. When I visited for the first time, something about the mountains in the background and the narrow main street that takes you through the bustling town, reminded me of the town I grew up in — Port Antonio, Jamaica.

## Walk us through a typical day.

In addition to fronting The Big Takeover, I am also a public school teacher. I work in Poughkeepsie city. My typical day would include me balancing my two careers. I teach during the weekdays, and dedicate my weekends to touring with The Big Takeover. We usually tour regionally during the school year, and nationally during the summer months.

## Where do you do your best creative work?

I feed very heavily off of my band mates. I rarely write independently, so I do my best creative work when I’m with [Rob Kissner](https://www.instagram.com/robkissner/) (the bassist, and primary music writer), or with more members of the band.

## How has the Hudson Valley influenced or impacted your creative work?

The Hudson Valley is filled with quite unique, creative, and open-minded individuals. This has forced us a musical group to maintain a high standard with the music we publish and the stage shows we perform. We know that in the Hudson Valley, the audience that comes to see us play will have a sophisticated ear that is very familiar with a certain quality of music. So we try to impress with our recordings and performances. Our Hudson Valley musical colleagues publish and perform high-quality music as well, so they provide a proper bar for us to meet consistently. Being Hudson Valley-based has helped us to continue to refine our craft.

## Anything you want to plug or promote?

The Big Takeover has recently released a single called _Weight of the World_ [[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7i2QvVWgwSOxTVwj9HTFSS?highlight=spotify:track:42HANbwn7y0gxuNTu5fSml)|[Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/weight-of-the-world-single/1511256949)]. It is a song that we recorded remotely in response to the current quarantine and COVID situation. It is available on all streaming platforms. We also created a video remotely for this single.
