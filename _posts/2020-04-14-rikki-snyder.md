## Hello! Who are you? Tell us about yourself. What are you passionate about? What do you enjoy doing?

Hi! I’m Rikki. I’m a photographer specializing in food, interiors and lifestyle. I’m super passionate about my work and after doing this for 10 years I still love it just as much as the day I started! When I’m not working, you can almost always find me in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes because I love to cook. I also love to read up on nutrition which is a new(er) found passion of mine.

## How did you discover the Hudson Valley?

I am actually a Hudson Valley native! I grew up outside of Poughkeepsie. After going to photography school in MA and then moving to NYC for a while, I found myself back in the Hudson Valley… right in Beacon!

## Walk us through a typical day.

I have two kinds of typical days being a freelance photographer. I am either at home editing photos and working on emails/back end of the business or I am out and about on a shoot. I love the balance of the two because when I’m working from home I can stay in and make a nice breakfast, hang out with my pup and take things a little slower. When I’m on a shoot, especially if it’s in the city, I’m up super early and it’s all go-go-go! But I love having that balance.

## Do you have a go-to coffee or beer order, and from where?

My go-to coffee order at the moment is a turmeric latte with almond milk from Ella’s in Beacon! _[Ed. note: [Ella’s Bellas](https://www.ellasbellasbeacon.com/) was recently sold and the location is now [Kitchen & Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/kitchen.coffee.beacon/), but it’s kept most of the old menu, including the turmeric latte. I highly recommend it too!]_ And my favorite cocktail is the Snuff Box at [Brasserie 292](https://www.brasserie292.com/) in Poughkeepsie.

## Where do you do your best creative work?

Usually when I’m in a certain environment surrounded by something beautiful. That typically  means on a pretty farm or somewhere where color and nature is very present.

## How has the Hudson Valley influenced or impacted your creative work?

I don’t think I knew how much the Hudson Valley impacted my creative work until I moved away! I realized just how beautiful the area is and that growing up here had such a significant impact on my work. I’d honestly say that if I didn’t grow up here my work wouldn’t exist! It has influenced me so immensely.

## What’s surprised you most about living and working in the Hudson Valley?

How so many people have ties to the Hudson Valley in one way or another and how the community of creatives that now live here keeps growing which is super exciting.

## Anything you want to plug or promote?

I am always looking for homes to photograph and pitch to media outlets so if anyone has a home they think would be great I’d love to get in touch!
