She‚Äôs also a partner at the coworking space CO in Rhinebeck and a startup advisor working with a handful of female-led and Hudson Valley ventures.

## Hello! Who are you? Tell us about yourself. What are you passionate about? What do you enjoy doing?

Hi! I‚Äôm the founder of a crypto startup called [Gracias](https://getgracias.com/). Gracias is a mission-driven company, working to drive Bitcoin adoption amongst young women and teens from diverse backgrounds. I‚Äôm passionate about bringing Bitcoin education to people in underserved communities, so that they understand the characteristics of this new, evolving economy and the choices they have about their money. Ultimately I‚Äôm driven by financial empowerment, and I see crypto as a direct path for many people to achieve that.

Other projects that I‚Äôm involved with include [CO](https://www.coworkwith.co/), a co-working and events space in Rhinebeck. I‚Äôm an advisor to a female-founded travel startup called [Allcall](http://allcall.co/). I truly love helping other founders navigate the rough terrains of starting a company and launching a product, and helping female founders is particularly rewarding. I‚Äôm also an advisor to [Hempire State Growers](https://hempirestategrowers.com/), a Hudson Valley collective of hemp farmers.

Besides these things, I love doing hot yoga, going on low-key hikes with my 3-year-old son, and eating at diners all over the Hudson Valley.

## How did you discover the Hudson Valley?

I grew up in West Hurley! I went to West Hurley elementary and attended Onteora as a teen. I left at 18 and moved around LA, Brooklyn, London, and Glasgow, but I came back to the area about 5 years ago and bought a house in midtown Kingston earlier this year. I love it! My mom and her partner Amy Hepworth run [Hepworth Farms](https://www.hepworthfarms.com/) in Milton, so I‚Äôve also spent some time living down in that neck of the woods on their farm.

## Walk us through a typical day.

I wake up stupidly early most days, not by choice but because my body just refuses to sleep in. I‚Äôd like to say that I spend these precious early morning hours journaling, meditating or exercising, but truth be told I usually just have some coffee and read Twitter. Prize idiot, I know! When my husband and son eventually get up, we‚Äôll turn on the radio and start prepping for the day. [FIP](https://www.fip.fr/) is a family favorite and it‚Äôs on almost constantly in our house.

Once or twice a week I head into the city for meetings. I‚Äôm loyal to Metro-North, and I usually hike it down to Poughkeepsie and take an early train. On most of the other days I work from home, or else I‚Äôll go into CO if I‚Äôm needing some energizing proximity to other humans. CO is great for getting a lot of quiet, reflective work done, and it‚Äôs also so nice to be in a beautiful shared space with other people. I find that working from home too many days in a row can be taxing on my mental health, so having CO nearby is hugely valuable to keep my perspective in check.

I usually have a check-in with Gracias co-founder [Chris Garrett](https://twitter.com/czgarrett) at some point during the day. We talk through priorities and progress, and tackle any big problems that need to be solved together. After that I‚Äôm on the phone for a while, talking with potential hires, pitching partners or investors, or connecting with other people in the crypto or startup ecosystem. Marketing, legal, product, and/or admin work fills the rest of the day very quickly.

Many days I have [a text thread going](https://twitter.com/medeana/status/1177254029358960640) with another female founder friend to keep ourselves on track and pumped up. This is so critical to keeping my morale intact, as early stage startup life is filled so little external validation and so much rejection.

On good days I‚Äôll find a break for a yoga class at some point, and then I pick up my son from daycare. After that it‚Äôs almost always a family dinner, which I rarely sacrifice unless I‚Äôm traveling. Many days I‚Äôm in bed embarrassingly early.

## Where are your favorite places to spend time in the Hudson Valley?

I love diners and my family and I spend a lot of time in them! ¬†Our local is [Kings Valley Diner](https://www.kingsvalleydiner.com/Home) on Albany Avenue, and it‚Äôs solid. [Alexis Diner](http://www.thealexisdiner.com/) in Newburgh ranks highly for us as well ‚Äî it‚Äôs always a good time in there! To me there‚Äôs just something really special about being in a buzzy diner filled with people from all different walks of life, communing over coffee and omelettes.

For non-diner food, I love:

- üçï [Tony‚Äôs Pizzeria](https://www.facebook.com/TonysPizzeria1937/) (Kingston)

- üç∏ [Lis Bar](https://www.lisbar.com/) (Kingston)

- üá©üá™ [Gunk Haus](https://www.gunkhaus.com/) (Highland)

- üåÆ [Diego‚Äôs Taqueria](https://diegostaqueria.com/) (Kingston)

- ‚òï [Village Coffee and Goods](https://www.villagecoffeeandgoods.com/) (Kingston)

- ü•ê [Murray‚Äôs](https://www.murraystivoli.com/) (Tivoli)

I do a lot of hot yoga and I love [Rock Yoga](http://www.nprockyoga.com/) in New Paltz. It‚Äôs a gorgeous studio with a really welcoming community. [The Hot Spot](https://www.hotspotkingston.com/) in Kingston is great too. You are guaranteed a really brutal (but amazing) workout when you go there!

## Do you have a go-to coffee or beer order, and from where?

How about a margarita from Diego‚Äôs Taqueria, on the rocks with salt, please! Or, a cappuccino from Village Goods & Coffee, paired with one of their amazing baked goods.

## Where do you do your best creative work?

I do my best creative work when I‚Äôm with other people. Not to plug CO (again), but one of the things that I get out of that community is the rich, and often unexpected, conversations with the wide variety of people that work from there.

After that, my most productive time is while I‚Äôm driving. Something about the focused monotony makes the brain wheels turn ‚Äî 9W is the site of my best work!

## How has the Hudson Valley influenced or impacted your creative work?

The work/life balance and quality of life that the Hudson Valley affords me and my family has been absolutely critical for my development as a founder and entrepreneur. I simply wouldn‚Äôt have been able to take the financial risk that comes with starting a company if I lived in the city. So, living here has meant everything to me in terms of being confident and financially flexible enough to start Gracias and pursue it full-time.

## What‚Äôs surprised you most about living and working in the Hudson Valley?

The way in which the Hudson Valley economy is changing and evolving is one of the most surprising things about being back here. Growing up, it was all about IBM. Times have changed, obviously, and it‚Äôs so interesting to see what is emerging in that corporate vacuum. The freelance, remote, and gig economy has given a new life to this area and it‚Äôs so nice to see. That said, it‚Äôs not without its challenges. I do walk around feeling like I‚Äôm straddling the worlds of ‚Äúnew Hudson Valley‚Äù and ‚Äúold Hudson Valley‚Äù and I wish there was more authentic and respectful connection between the two.

## Are you part of any local groups or communities you‚Äôd like to mention?

I‚Äôve started co-hosting a monthly Games Night at CO! I recently learned Settlers of Catan and I‚Äôm obsessed. All are welcome at Games Night! Even total beginners ‚Äî which I was myself not too long ago! There are all types of games available to play, and you don‚Äôt need to be a CO member to participate.
