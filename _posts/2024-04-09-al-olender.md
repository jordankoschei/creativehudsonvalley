You might know Al Olender from her annual Alentine's Day performance in Kingston. Or maybe you've seen her on her current tour with indie-folk duo Shovels & Rope, or onstage at the Newport Folk Festival. But it's also likely you know her from a mulitude of Kingston hotspots, where she's a regular fixture and an active member of the community.

I spoke to Al as she was driving to a show in Vermont, midway through her latest tour, to talk about how she came to the Hudson Valley, her favorite spots in Kingston, and how the region has impacted her work as a musician.

## What's your relationship to the Hudson Valley?

The Hudson Valley is where I call home; I live in Kingston.

I grew up in Baltimore and I had no idea what the Hudson Valley was. But moving here, I've created such a beautiful deep community and I've totally fallen in love with the Hudson Valley.

I lived in Beacon for one year and Kingston for the rest, and it feels like the first place I've ever lived since living in Maryland that I can call home.

## How did you find Kingston?

It came to me in a dream! No, just kidding.

I moved to the Hudson Valley initially to join a band. I lived in Beacon for one year chasing dreams, and then [James Felice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Felice_Brothers) took me to Kingston for the first time. I ultimately fell in love with it and decided that, when you find your people so immediately, you just want to make a life there.

## What are your favorite spots in Kingston?

[Rough Draft](https://www.roughdraftny.com/) is truly my favorite coffee shop in the entire country. I've been everywhere, and it's my favorite place to go.

I love [Camp Kingston](https://www.campkingston.com/). It's a new place for all kinds of artistic, beautiful projects and food and coffee and snacks and community.

I love [Lovefield Vintage](https://www.lovefieldvintage.com/), I love [Chleo](https://www.chleovin.com/) wine bar, I love [Stockade Tavern](https://www.stockadetavern.com/), I love [Brunette](https://www.brunettewinebar.com/) wine bar down in the Rondout.

There are too many to count. I'm such a Kingston girl, I'll be bopping around [Village Coffee and Goods](https://www.villagecoffeeandgoods.com/) and [People's Place](https://www.peoplesplace.org/) and just everywhere in town. There's [Eliza](https://www.elizakingston.com/) and I love the new [Ollie's Slice Shop](https://www.olliessliceshop.com/), [Graziano's Downtown Cafe](https://www.grazianosdowntowncafe.com/)... I could keep on gushing about how important Kingston spots are.

## How has the Hudson Valley impacted your work as a musician?

It's completely transformed my work as a musician. All my songs are personally influenced by my life experiences. I'm not much of a storyteller of fictional stories -- I write a lot about what's happening to me and where I am.

Kingston and the Hudson Valley have influenced my work so much, and especially the sophomore record that I'm working on.

## What Hudson Valley musicians inspire you?

I have to give such huge credit to [the Felice Brothers](https://www.thefelicebrothers.com/) who took me on my first solo tour two years ago. They're such staples of the Hudson Valley community and they're so inspiring to me.

[Aubrey Haddard](https://www.aubreyhaddard.com/) and [Mikaela Davis](https://www.mikaeladavis.com/) are huge to me. My singing partner, Amanda Brooklyn, is just a beautiful voice and a beautiful person. The Hudson Valley is full of really special folks. I'm just glad to be around them.

## What have you found challenging about life in the Hudson Valley as a musician?

My experience here has been so positive and beautiful, but you know what's challenging about being a musician in Kingston? It's writing songs about this small, small community that I live in and finding the thin line between being open in my music while protecting the people that I love.

Even when I've been heartbroken or friend-hurt, or something has happened in our community that's annoyed me, or if I've been annoying... I write about my experiences, but we all see each other at the same coffee shop every day. I want to respect people and be respected, and living in a small town really teaches you about that. Kingston has taught me a lot of lessons.

## Do you have anything you want to plug or promote?

Let me call my management team! Just kidding, I've got this.

I'm on tour right now with [Shovels & Rope](https://www.shovelsandrope.com/), which is incredible.

Every February, I do an annual show in Kingston called [Alentine's Day](https://www.tixr.com/groups/impactconcerts/events/alentine-s-day-58938), and next February is going to be the third time. It's far away, but it comes up quickly.

This summer's going to be huge -- more tour announcements, more dates, a summer show in the Hudson Valley.

And people should be on the lookout for my second album, which isn't finished yet but is coming!
